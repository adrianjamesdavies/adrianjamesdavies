The following commands can discover all the SUID executables 
that are running on the system. More specifically the commands will try to 
find files in the / directory owned by the user root that have the SUID 
permission bits, print them and then redirect all errors to /dev/null in 
order to list only the binaries that the user has permissions to access.


find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;
